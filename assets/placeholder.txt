This folder would contain the following images:

1. profile.jpg - A professional headshot of the developer
2. project1.jpg - Screenshot of the E-commerce Website project
3. project2.jpg - Screenshot of the Task Management App project
4. project3.jpg - Screenshot of the Travel App UI Design project
5. project4.jpg - Screenshot of the Portfolio Website project
5. project5.jpg - Screenshot of the Weather Dashboard project
6. project6.jpg - Screenshot of the Finance App UI project

In a real implementation, these would be actual image files rather than this placeholder text file.
